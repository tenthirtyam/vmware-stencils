## Dos and Don'ts:

* Do use the Metropolis font.
* Do create the text blocks first to determine if a design can fit in the maximum width when a graphic may contain a lot of text
* Do not use a type size smaller than 11 points.
* Do not scale the icons and shapes. They will appear different than all other graphics in the documentation.
* Do not use different paper formats. It may cause problems with the graphic appearance.
 
>**NOTE:**
All official diagrams are provided in the product documentation found at docs.vmware.com.
